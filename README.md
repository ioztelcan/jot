# jot

Jot down notes.

# Installation

Currently there is no packaging. You need `node.js` at any version at or above `15.0.1`

I recommend getting nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and installing correct version with:

`nvm install 15.0.1`

Once you sort out the dependencies you can either just run the script where it is like `./jot` or move it to some location indexed by your PATH.

# Dependencies

- npm
- chalk
- lowdb

`npm install --save [library]` to install once you have installed npm.

# Usage

TODO: Put some usage stuff here.
